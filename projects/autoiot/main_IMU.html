/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data.

Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR, for example, may be utilized to identify and monitor the motions of pedestrians, bicycles, and other automobiles in the environment, allowing self-driving cars to predict and prevent collisions. HAR can also recognize driver behavior, such as hand signals and head movements, which can help self-driving cars communicate with human drivers.Pro tip: Check out 9 Revolutionary AI Applications In TransportationHuman/computer interactionHuman Activity Recognition can be used to identify and classify human gestures and movements, which can be utilized to improve computer system usability and accessibility. HAR can be used to enable gesture-based commands of electronic devices like smartphones and smart TVs, resulting in an even more natural and easily understood user interface. HAR can also provide voice-based automation of computer systems, such as virtual personal assistants and chatbots, allowing for more practical and effective communication with computers. Furthermore, HAR can monitor computer users' health and wellness by identifying and categorizing their physical movements and behaviors, which can help prevent and reduce the harmful impacts of prolonged computer use, including eye strain, back pain, etc.GamingHuman Activity Recognition has several uses in the gaming industry. HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

The long-range activities were performed in an unconstrained way (participants received only a few instructions) and in a continuous (untrimmed) sequence, resulting in long videos (40 min on average per subject).Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data SetThe Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set is a publicly available dataset that contains sensor readings from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope captured during six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.The dataset includes 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

                        These files enact the data transfromation process where files of raw accelerometer
                        data are converted to Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF files) for use with WEKA 
                        machine learning software.
                   		standalone_public_v1.0.jar is called with two arguments, a filepath to the input file 
                        (i.e. raw data file to read) and a filepath to the output file (i.e. arff file to be 
                        written to)
                        The source code for standalone_public_v1.0.jar is also provided with: 
                        StandAloneFeat.java
                        TupFeat.java
                        FeatureLib.java
                        Descriptions of the features produced by this process can be found in the literature 
                        mentioned above as well as the about files for the transformed data of our published 
                        datasets.
                        For our transformation process, we take 10 seconds worth of
                        accelerometer samples (200 records/lines in the raw file)
                        and transform them into a single example/tuple of 46 values.
                        Most of the features we generate are simple statistical
                        measures.
                        Things to note:
                        An error concerning the number of tuples saved was recently found and corrected 
                        in the source code, so this particular version of the JAR file is not the same 
                        one used to create the transformed data from the raw data that is currently 
                        published on our site.
                        During the transformation process, only the first character of the activity label 
                        from the raw data files are used when creating the arff files.  Because some of 
                        our activities begin with the same letter (i.e. Stairs, Standing, Sitting) if these 
                        labels are present in the raw files and the JAR file is called, one cannot distinguish
                        between the activites in the arff files because theu activity label will be the same 
                        for multiple activites.  WISDM uses a single-character labeling system to represent 
                        the activities we recognize, and simple perl scipts are called when it is necessary 
                        to translate between the full activity label and our single character system.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.
           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.
             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.
     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects. It is widely used as a benchmark for HAR algorithms. KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset: This dataset comprises videos demonstrating six human activities, including walking, jogging, running, boxing, handwaving, and handclapping. It is commonly utilized for action recognition and activity classification tasks.

Figure: Human Activity Recognition in Health Monitoring ApplicationFor example, HAR is widely used to monitor medication adherence by analyzing patient activities through smartphone sensors.Through Remote patient engagement and assessment methods, which include the measurement of digital biomarkers and real-time monitoring of medication dosing, adherence to prescribed medications can be ensured. The dosing support solution operates through a smartphone application, where patients receive alerts reminding them to take their medication and are guided through the correct administration process. One such company is AICure which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics to oversee patient behavior and facilitate remote engagement in clinical trials.2) Applications of Human Activity Recognition in the Sports and Fitness IndustryHAR is employed in the sports and fitness industry for sports performance analysis to track and evaluate athletes' movements and techniques. HAR is mostly utilized to provide insights into player performance, injury prevention, and training optimization.This is primarily achieved using wearable tracking devices and data analytics. These devices, such as GPS trackers and inertial sensors, are designed to collect various metrics during training or competition, including player movement, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and positional data. This data is then transmitted wirelessly to a central system for analysis.The central system employs advanced data analytics algorithms to process and interpret the collected data. It provides valuable insights into athlete performance, workload, and injury risk. Coaches, trainers, and sports scientists can access this information through user-friendly dashboards and visualizations to make data-driven decisions and optimize training strategies.
       Figure: Sports Analysis using Catapult’s SoftwareCatapult's Sports technology is widely used in professional sports leagues, including soccer, basketball, American football, and rugby, as well as in collegiate and Olympic-level programs. 3) Applications of Human Activity Recognition in Securit and SurveillanceHAR is utilized in security systems to identify suspicious activities and enhance surveillance. Camio, a video surveillance company, uses HAR algorithms to detect and classify human actions in real time, enabling proactive security measures.The goal of introducing HAR in the surveillance industry is to make videos valuable and actionable by transforming it into real-time insights and alerts. This can be done by leveraging advanced computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence algorithms to extract valuable information from video streams.Camio's platform is designed to be flexible and scalable, capable of processing video streams from various sources such as IP cameras, smartphones, and drones. Using cloud infrastructure, Camio provides their clients with real-time video analysis and monitoring capabilities.4) Application of HAR in Manufacturing IndustriesIn industrial settings, Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is implemented to monitor worker activities and effectively ensure safety protocol adherence.

They focus on developing innovative wearable devices and software solutions that empower individuals and organizations to track and analyze human movement data.Through wearable devices, statistical data demonstrates a significant reduction in manual injuries by 50-60% while increasing working efficiency by an impressive 72%. These advantages highlight the positive impact of wearable technology on workplace safety and productivity.5) Application of HAR in the Gaming IndustryHuman activity recognition (HAR) has several applications in the gaming industry, enhancing the gaming experience and enabling more immersive gameplay. With the help of HAR, systems accurately track and recognize various human activities, such as running, jumping, punching, or swinging a sword.This data is then used to control and animate the in-game characters, allowing players to engage in virtual environments using their own body movements.Xsens is a leading provider of 3D motion capture technology and solutions. They offer a range of products and software that enable real-time human motion tracking and analysis. In the gaming industry, Xsens technology captures players' movements and translates them into in-game actions.ConclusionHuman activity recognition (HAR) is a field that uses computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. It involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various human activities, gestures, and behaviors. HAR has applications in healthcare, sports, surveillance, and other domains.HAR relies on techniques such as pose estimation, which determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video by identifying key points or joints. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for pose estimation.Data collection for HAR involves using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors, which capture motion, direction, and location information. The collected sensor data is then preprocessed by filtering out noise, extracting relevant features, segmenting the data, normalizing the features, and reducing dimensionality.HAR model selection includes decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and neural networks. Decision trees and random forests provide interpretability and handle complex data, SVMs handle high-dimensional data, HMMs are suitable for time-series data, and neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs, are effective for handling time-series and visual data, respectively.Several datasets are commonly used for HAR research, including the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset, UCF101, HMDB51, and ActivityNet.Real-life applications of HAR include healthcare and wellness monitoring, sports performance analysis, security and surveillance systems, industrial safety monitoring, and enhancing the gaming experience.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What are the different types of human activity recognition?Different types of human activity recognition include Sensor-Based Activity Recognition, Single-User Activity Recognition, Multi-User Activity Recognition, and Group Activity Recognition.What is the meaning of activity recognition?Activity recognition refers to predicting human movement or activities based on sensor data, typically from devices like smartphone accelerometers.

The WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) Lab is concerned with collecting the sensor data from smart phones and other modern 
            mobile devices (e.g., tablet computers, music players, etc.) and mining this sensor data for useful knowledge. Currently our efforts are 
            mainly focused on the acclerometer and GPS sensor data from these devices, but in the future we will mine the audio sensors (microphones), 
            image sensors (cameras), light sensors, proximity sensors, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, direction sensors (compasses) and 
            various other sensors that reside on these devices.
Our work on activity recognition allows us to recognize many of the physical activities that a smart phone user is performing (walking, 
            jogging, sitting, etc.) based on the user's movements, as measured by the smart phone's tri-axial accelerometer. This work is described in 
            a publication and will soon result in the public deployment of our 
            Actitracker service, which will permit a user to track the activities that they or their family perform, 
            via a web-based interface, by downloading our smartphone app. Our work on accelerometer-based biometric identification is also detailed 
            in another publication, which describes how we can identify a user based on his or her acclerometer 
            data. We are in the process of exploring how GPS data can be mined to provide valuable services and have made a lot of progress in this 
            area since the summer of 2012.

The WISDM Lab is led by Dr. Gary Weiss, a faculty member in the department 
            of Computer and Information Science at Fordham University. 
            The WISDM Lab includes over a dozen members, most of which are Fordham undergraduates. Our project is 
            currently based on the Android platform and Android-based smartphones. This research has been generously supported by Fordham 
            University, Fordham's Undergraduate College at Rose Hill, the National Science Foundation, and Google Inc.

Join us at one of our meetings! The WISDM Lab usually meets once a week in John Mulcahy Hall at Fordham University's 
            Rose Hill Campus. If interested, please contact Dr. Weiss for the latest updates.

                        These files enact the data transfromation process where files of raw accelerometer
                        data are converted to Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF files) for use with WEKA 
                        machine learning software.
                   		standalone_public_v1.0.jar is called with two arguments, a filepath to the input file 
                        (i.e. raw data file to read) and a filepath to the output file (i.e. arff file to be 
                        written to)
                        The source code for standalone_public_v1.0.jar is also provided with: 
                        StandAloneFeat.java
                        TupFeat.java
                        FeatureLib.java
                        Descriptions of the features produced by this process can be found in the literature 
                        mentioned above as well as the about files for the transformed data of our published 
                        datasets.
                        For our transformation process, we take 10 seconds worth of
                        accelerometer samples (200 records/lines in the raw file)
                        and transform them into a single example/tuple of 46 values.
                        Most of the features we generate are simple statistical
                        measures.
                        Things to note:
                        An error concerning the number of tuples saved was recently found and corrected 
                        in the source code, so this particular version of the JAR file is not the same 
                        one used to create the transformed data from the raw data that is currently 
                        published on our site.
                        During the transformation process, only the first character of the activity label 
                        from the raw data files are used when creating the arff files.  Because some of 
                        our activities begin with the same letter (i.e. Stairs, Standing, Sitting) if these 
                        labels are present in the raw files and the JAR file is called, one cannot distinguish
                        between the activites in the arff files because theu activity label will be the same 
                        for multiple activites.  WISDM uses a single-character labeling system to represent 
                        the activities we recognize, and simple perl scipts are called when it is necessary 
                        to translate between the full activity label and our single character system.

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.Convolutional Neural NetworksConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning architecture that excels at processing image and video data. CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.
           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.
             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.
     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects.

Human Activity Recognition in Health Monitoring ApplicationHealthcare and Wellness: HAR Techniques can monitor patient activities and detects abnormal behavior or changes in daily routines.
Figure: Human Activity Recognition in Health Monitoring ApplicationFor example, HAR is widely used to monitor medication adherence by analyzing patient activities through smartphone sensors.Through Remote patient engagement and assessment methods, which include the measurement of digital biomarkers and real-time monitoring of medication dosing, adherence to prescribed medications can be ensured. The dosing support solution operates through a smartphone application, where patients receive alerts reminding them to take their medication and are guided through the correct administration process. One such company is AICure which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics to oversee patient behavior and facilitate remote engagement in clinical trials.2) Applications of Human Activity Recognition in the Sports and Fitness IndustryHAR is employed in the sports and fitness industry for sports performance analysis to track and evaluate athletes' movements and techniques. HAR is mostly utilized to provide insights into player performance, injury prevention, and training optimization.This is primarily achieved using wearable tracking devices and data analytics. These devices, such as GPS trackers and inertial sensors, are designed to collect various metrics during training or competition, including player movement, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and positional data. This data is then transmitted wirelessly to a central system for analysis.The central system employs advanced data analytics algorithms to process and interpret the collected data. It provides valuable insights into athlete performance, workload, and injury risk.

It involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various human activities, gestures, and behaviors. HAR has applications in healthcare, sports, surveillance, and other domains.HAR relies on techniques such as pose estimation, which determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video by identifying key points or joints. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for pose estimation.Data collection for HAR involves using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors, which capture motion, direction, and location information. The collected sensor data is then preprocessed by filtering out noise, extracting relevant features, segmenting the data, normalizing the features, and reducing dimensionality.HAR model selection includes decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVMs), hidden Markov models (HMMs), and neural networks. Decision trees and random forests provide interpretability and handle complex data, SVMs handle high-dimensional data, HMMs are suitable for time-series data, and neural networks, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and CNNs, are effective for handling time-series and visual data, respectively.Several datasets are commonly used for HAR research, including the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset, KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset, UCF101, HMDB51, and ActivityNet.Real-life applications of HAR include healthcare and wellness monitoring, sports performance analysis, security and surveillance systems, industrial safety monitoring, and enhancing the gaming experience.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)What are the different types of human activity recognition?Different types of human activity recognition include Sensor-Based Activity Recognition, Single-User Activity Recognition, Multi-User Activity Recognition, and Group Activity Recognition.What is the meaning of activity recognition?Activity recognition refers to predicting human movement or activities based on sensor data, typically from devices like smartphone accelerometers.

</span><span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Step 1: Data Preprocessing
- Load the raw accelerometer data from 'WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt' using Python's pandas library for efficient data handling.
- Parse the data to separate user ID, activity label, and sensor readings (x, y, z). Use regular expressions for accurate parsing since the data might be in a space-separated format.
- Address missing values by using pandas' interpolation methods or drop incomplete records if the dataset is large enough to afford it.
- Normalize the sensor data using scikit-learn's StandardScaler to ensure each feature has zero mean and unit variance.
- Segment the data into fixed-size windows using numpy, typically 10 seconds worth of data per sample. Assign the label to each segment based on the majority label within that window.

Step 2: Dataset Preparation
- Split the preprocessed data into training and testing datasets using scikit-learn’s train_test_split function, ensuring a balanced distribution of activity classes.
- Convert the segmented data into PyTorch tensors using torch.tensor(), making them ready for input into a neural network.
- Utilize PyTorch's DataLoader to create efficient iterables over the dataset, enabling batching and shuffling for the training process.

Step 3: Model Design
- Choose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture suitable for time-series data, like a 1D CNN, to capture patterns over time.
- Define the network layers using PyTorch’s nn.Module, incorporating layers such as nn.Conv1d, nn.ReLU, nn.MaxPool1d, and nn.Linear.
- Implement dropout layers using nn.Dropout to prevent overfitting, and ensure the forward pass handles input data correctly to produce activity predictions.

Step 4: Training the Model
- Define CrossEntropyLoss from PyTorch as the loss function since it is suitable for multi-class classification tasks.
- Use the Adam optimizer from PyTorch's optim module to update model weights based on computed gradients.
- Train the model over multiple epochs, iterating through batches of training data, and updating weights to minimize the loss. Track training progress with metrics like accuracy and loss using PyTorch's autograd.

Step 5: Model Evaluation
- Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to assess its generalization performance.
- Calculate the average recognition accuracy using sklearn's accuracy_score function by comparing predicted activity labels against true labels.
- Use a confusion matrix from sklearn.metrics to analyze misclassifications and understand specific activities that are challenging to recognize.

Step 6: Output the Results
- Print the average recognition accuracy achieved on the test dataset for evaluation purposes.
- Save the trained model using torch.save() for potential future use or further optimization.</span>

The WISDM (Wireless Sensor Data Mining) Lab is concerned with collecting the sensor data from smart phones and other modern 
            mobile devices (e.g., tablet computers, music players, etc.) and mining this sensor data for useful knowledge. Currently our efforts are 
            mainly focused on the acclerometer and GPS sensor data from these devices, but in the future we will mine the audio sensors (microphones), 
            image sensors (cameras), light sensors, proximity sensors, temperature sensors, pressure sensors, direction sensors (compasses) and 
            various other sensors that reside on these devices.
Our work on activity recognition allows us to recognize many of the physical activities that a smart phone user is performing (walking, 
            jogging, sitting, etc.) based on the user's movements, as measured by the smart phone's tri-axial accelerometer. This work is described in 
            a publication and will soon result in the public deployment of our 
            Actitracker service, which will permit a user to track the activities that they or their family perform, 
            via a web-based interface, by downloading our smartphone app. Our work on accelerometer-based biometric identification is also detailed 
            in another publication, which describes how we can identify a user based on his or her acclerometer 
            data. We are in the process of exploring how GPS data can be mined to provide valuable services and have made a lot of progress in this 
            area since the summer of 2012.

The WISDM Lab is led by Dr. Gary Weiss, a faculty member in the department 
            of Computer and Information Science at Fordham University. 
            The WISDM Lab includes over a dozen members, most of which are Fordham undergraduates. Our project is 
            currently based on the Android platform and Android-based smartphones. This research has been generously supported by Fordham 
            University, Fordham's Undergraduate College at Rose Hill, the National Science Foundation, and Google Inc.

Join us at one of our meetings! The WISDM Lab usually meets once a week in John Mulcahy Hall at Fordham University's 
            Rose Hill Campus. If interested, please contact Dr. Weiss for the latest updates.

                        These files enact the data transfromation process where files of raw accelerometer
                        data are converted to Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF files) for use with WEKA 
                        machine learning software.
                   		standalone_public_v1.0.jar is called with two arguments, a filepath to the input file 
                        (i.e. raw data file to read) and a filepath to the output file (i.e. arff file to be 
                        written to)
                        The source code for standalone_public_v1.0.jar is also provided with: 
                        StandAloneFeat.java
                        TupFeat.java
                        FeatureLib.java
                        Descriptions of the features produced by this process can be found in the literature 
                        mentioned above as well as the about files for the transformed data of our published 
                        datasets.
                        For our transformation process, we take 10 seconds worth of
                        accelerometer samples (200 records/lines in the raw file)
                        and transform them into a single example/tuple of 46 values.
                        Most of the features we generate are simple statistical
                        measures.
                        Things to note:
                        An error concerning the number of tuples saved was recently found and corrected 
                        in the source code, so this particular version of the JAR file is not the same 
                        one used to create the transformed data from the raw data that is currently 
                        published on our site.
                        During the transformation process, only the first character of the activity label 
                        from the raw data files are used when creating the arff files.  Because some of 
                        our activities begin with the same letter (i.e. Stairs, Standing, Sitting) if these 
                        labels are present in the raw files and the JAR file is called, one cannot distinguish
                        between the activites in the arff files because theu activity label will be the same 
                        for multiple activites.  WISDM uses a single-character labeling system to represent 
                        the activities we recognize, and simple perl scipts are called when it is necessary 
                        to translate between the full activity label and our single character system.

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

Let’s go through a few flagship examples.Applications of Human Activity Recognition (source)Sports performance analysisHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) can analyze sports performance in various ways. It may be utilized to track and analyze athletes' movements during competition and training, anticipate new injury risks, assess the effectiveness of different training programs, follow individual athletes' growth, and examine team sports' tactical and strategic components. For example, HAR can be used to analyze badminton players' movements during attempting to hit and smash, track runners' movements and identify possible overuse injuries, monitor soccer players' performance during a game, track tennis players' movements throughout a match and identify the areas for enhanced foot movement and positioning, or analyze basketball players' actions during a game to recognize possibilities to improve team defense and ball movement.Keypoint annotations in the V7 toolPro tip: Check out 7 Game-Changing AI Applications in the Sports IndustrySelf-driving carsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) has numerous uses in self-driving cars. HAR may be employed to detect people and other vehicles on the road, increasing the effectiveness and security of self-driving automobiles. HAR, for example, may be utilized to identify and monitor the motions of pedestrians, bicycles, and other automobiles in the environment, allowing self-driving cars to predict and prevent collisions. HAR can also recognize driver behavior, such as hand signals and head movements, which can help self-driving cars communicate with human drivers.Pro tip: Check out 9 Revolutionary AI Applications In TransportationHuman/computer interactionHuman Activity Recognition can be used to identify and classify human gestures and movements, which can be utilized to improve computer system usability and accessibility. HAR can be used to enable gesture-based commands of electronic devices like smartphones and smart TVs, resulting in an even more natural and easily understood user interface. HAR can also provide voice-based automation of computer systems, such as virtual personal assistants and chatbots, allowing for more practical and effective communication with computers. Furthermore, HAR can monitor computer users' health and wellness by identifying and categorizing their physical movements and behaviors, which can help prevent and reduce the harmful impacts of prolonged computer use, including eye strain, back pain, etc.GamingHuman Activity Recognition has several uses in the gaming industry. HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

IntroductionHuman activity recognition (HAR) refers to using computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. HAR involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various forms of human motion, including activities, gestures, and behaviors. This data is then translated into actionable commands that computers can execute and analyze using HAR algorithms.Human activity recognition (HAR) has numerous applications across various domains. In healthcare, HAR can monitor and assess patients' movements and activities to detect abnormalities, track rehabilitation progress, or provide personalized care.
           Figure: Human Activity RecognitionIn sports and athletics, HAR can analyze athletes' performance, provide feedback on technique, and prevent injuries by identifying improper movements. HAR also finds application in surveillance systems, which can automatically detect and classify suspicious or abnormal activities for enhanced security. Vision-based HAR systems often employ pose estimation techniques, which provide valuable insights into human behavior. Pose estimation is crucial in tasks like HAR, content extraction, and semantic comprehension. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks, are commonly used in pose estimation.One of the significant challenges in HAR is considering various factors such as physical attributes, cultural markers, direction, and pose types. For instance, distinguishing between a person falling and attempting a handstand can be difficult.Addressing this uncertainty requires the development of novel methods within the artificial intelligence framework.Researchers are exploring techniques such as multi-modal and graph-based learning to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems. These approaches involve incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between different body parts.In addition, to pose estimation and model complexity, HAR faces other challenges. Disparities in sensor data due to the placement of sensors, variations in human movement patterns, overlapping activities that interfere with accurate recognition, noisy data causing distortions, and the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection methods are some of the prominent challenges in the field.What is Pose Estimation?Pose estimation is a task in computer vision that involves determining the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video. It can be thought of as the process of inferring the pose based on the given visual data. This is achieved by identifying and tracking specific points, known as key points, on the object or person of interest.
             Figure: Pose EstimationThese key points can be significant features or joints, such as corners for objects or major joints like elbows or knees for humans. By analyzing these key points' spatial relationships and movements, pose estimation algorithms can estimate the pose accurately.How Does AI-Based Human Activity Recognition Work?AI-based human activity recognition utilizes advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques to analyze sensor data and identify and classify human activities. The major steps involved include:Data CollectionData PreprocessingModel Selection and TrainingThis section focuses on a pipeline for how general Human Activity Recogonition is developed. 1.  Data CollectionHAR data is commonly gathered using sensors attached to or worn by the user. These sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors.Accelerometers can detect changes in motion and direction and measure velocity along three axes (x, y, and z). On the other hand, Magnetometers can perceive magnetic fields and their orientation, while gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors can provide information about the user's location and movement, although they are not frequently used in HAR due to their high power consumption and limited accuracy indoors.The sensor data collected is typically recorded as time-series data, where each sample represents the sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second).2. Data PreprocessingData preprocessing is a critical stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) as it plays a fundamental role in cleaning, transforming, and preparing raw sensor data for subsequent analysis and modeling. The following are key processes involved in data preparation:i) FilteringFiltering is a signal processing technique that removes noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. In HAR, various filters are applied depending on the frequency range of the signals of interest. Commonly used filters include low-pass filters, which allow low-frequency components to pass while attenuating high-frequency noise; high-pass filters, which suppress low-frequency noise and emphasize high-frequency variations; and band-pass filters, which selectively allow a specific range of frequencies to pass, effectively filtering out unwanted signals and enhancing the desired signals.ii) Feature extractionThe choice of features depends on the specific actions and the type of sensors used. For example, features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties (e.g., Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters) can be extracted with accelerometer data.These features capture essential characteristics of the motion patterns and provide relevant information for activity recognition.iii) Feature selectionFeature selection aims to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space while retaining the most informative and discriminative features. The performance and efficiency of activity identification algorithms can be improved by selecting the most relevant features. Features are evaluated based on their ability to distinguish between different activities, association with activity labels, and redundancy with other features.iv) Data SegmentationData Segmentation involves dividing the continuous stream of sensor data into smaller segments or windows to capture the temporal aspects of activities. The size and overlap of the windows depend on the duration and intensity of the activities being monitored. Segmentation enables the analysis of activity patterns within shorter time intervals, facilitating the extraction of meaningful features from specific activity segments.v) Data NormalizationData Normalization is a process that scales the features to have a standardized mean and variance, typically aiming for a mean of zero and a variance of one. This step ensures that the features from different sensors or participants are on a comparable scale, preventing any biases introduced by variations in sensor sensitivity or participant characteristics.vi) Dimensionality reductionDimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are applied to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA identifies the most significant components of the data, capturing the maximum variance and allowing for a lower-dimensional representation. t-SNE is a nonlinear technique that aims to preserve the local structure of the data, enabling visualization of high-dimensional data in a lower-dimensional space.vii) Missing Value ImputationMissing value imputation addresses the issue of incomplete sensor data, which can occur due to device malfunctions or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches, such as mean or median interpolation, can estimate missing values based on the available data, ensuring the data is complete and ready for analysis.viii) Data PreparationData preparation is a crucial stage in HAR as it directly impacts the accuracy and reliability of activity identification models. By effectively preprocessing the sensor data, removing noise, extracting informative features, and reducing dimensionality, researchers and practitioners can enhance the precision and dependability of HAR systems, leading to more robust and accurate activity recognition results.3. Model SelectionSeveral machine learning models have been successfully applied in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) tasks. Let's delve into some popular models used in detail:i) Decision TreesDecision Trees are simple yet effective models for classification tasks in HAR. They create a tree-like structure where each internal node represents a feature or attribute, and each leaf node corresponds to a class label. Decision trees can handle continuous and categorical data and capture non-linear interactions among features. They provide interpretability, allowing us to understand the decision-making process. However, decision trees can be prone to overfitting when the data is complex or noisy.ii) Random ForestRandom Forest is an ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees to improve performance and reduce overfitting. It creates a collection of decision trees, each trained on a different subset of the data with random feature subsets. The final prediction is made by aggregating the predictions from individual trees. Random forests can handle noisy and high-dimensional data and are robust against overfitting. They are computationally efficient and can handle missing values. However, they may require more computational resources compared to decision trees.iii) Support Vector Machines (SVMs)SVMs are potent models for linear and non-linear classification tasks in HAR. They aim to find an optimal hyperplane separating different classes by maximizing the margin between them. SVMs can handle high-dimensional data and are less prone to overfitting. They work well even with small to medium-sized datasets and can handle both continuous and categorical features.iv) Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)HMMs are statistical models widely used in HAR for recognizing sequential patterns in sensor data. They are particularly suitable for time-series data where the temporal dependencies between observations are important. HMMs consist of hidden states representing different activities and observed emissions corresponding to sensor measurements. They can capture the dynamics and transitions between different activities, making them effective for modeling complex activities with multiple steps.v) Neural NetworksActivity classification involves predicting future values from past data using statistical techniques and is commonly used for forecasting and analyzing sensor data. In human activity recognition, neural networks have shown great effectiveness. Two widely used approaches for this task are Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) models. Below we discuss both of these approaches in brief.Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)RNN models are particularly well-suited for handling time-series data. They can process sequences of variable lengths, making them ideal for activity recognition. Classifying activities using RNN models involves vectorizing video files, calculating descriptors to represent activity characteristics, forming a visual bag of words, feeding the descriptors into input layers, analyzing and classifying the data using RNN layers, and obtaining the final result.
     Figure: General Architecture for Recurrent Neural NetworksRNNs have been successfully employed in various applications, such as predicting pedestrian movements using camera and GPS data.2.  Convolutional Neural NetworkOn the other hand, CNN models are specialized neural networks known for their effectiveness in processing visual data. They are resilient to changes in scale, rotation, and other variations. CNNs have been widely used in image recognition, automatic number plate reading, and self-driving car software. An example of their application in human activity recognition is a 3D CNN algorithm that accurately reconstructs the three-dimensional pose of animals without the need for attached markers. This method proves beneficial for observing animals in both laboratory and wildlife settings. The training process involves assembling a dataset of synchronized video frames with labeled anatomical landmarks and training the CNN using this data.Some Important Datasets for Human Activity RecognitionIn this section, we discuss various datasets that can be used to train a computer vision model for Human Activity recognition.UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset: This dataset contains data from smartphones' accelerometers and gyroscope sensors, capturing various activities performed by different subjects. It is widely used as a benchmark for HAR algorithms. KTH Human Activity Recognition Dataset: This dataset comprises videos demonstrating six human activities, including walking, jogging, running, boxing, handwaving, and handclapping.

The dosing support solution operates through a smartphone application, where patients receive alerts reminding them to take their medication and are guided through the correct administration process. One such company is AICure which utilizes artificial intelligence (AI) and advanced data analytics to oversee patient behavior and facilitate remote engagement in clinical trials.2) Applications of Human Activity Recognition in the Sports and Fitness IndustryHAR is employed in the sports and fitness industry for sports performance analysis to track and evaluate athletes' movements and techniques. HAR is mostly utilized to provide insights into player performance, injury prevention, and training optimization.This is primarily achieved using wearable tracking devices and data analytics. These devices, such as GPS trackers and inertial sensors, are designed to collect various metrics during training or competition, including player movement, speed, acceleration, deceleration, and positional data. This data is then transmitted wirelessly to a central system for analysis.The central system employs advanced data analytics algorithms to process and interpret the collected data. It provides valuable insights into athlete performance, workload, and injury risk. Coaches, trainers, and sports scientists can access this information through user-friendly dashboards and visualizations to make data-driven decisions and optimize training strategies.

They focus on developing innovative wearable devices and software solutions that empower individuals and organizations to track and analyze human movement data.Through wearable devices, statistical data demonstrates a significant reduction in manual injuries by 50-60% while increasing working efficiency by an impressive 72%. These advantages highlight the positive impact of wearable technology on workplace safety and productivity.5) Application of HAR in the Gaming IndustryHuman activity recognition (HAR) has several applications in the gaming industry, enhancing the gaming experience and enabling more immersive gameplay. With the help of HAR, systems accurately track and recognize various human activities, such as running, jumping, punching, or swinging a sword.This data is then used to control and animate the in-game characters, allowing players to engage in virtual environments using their own body movements.Xsens is a leading provider of 3D motion capture technology and solutions. They offer a range of products and software that enable real-time human motion tracking and analysis. In the gaming industry, Xsens technology captures players' movements and translates them into in-game actions.ConclusionHuman activity recognition (HAR) is a field that uses computer and machine vision technology to interpret and understand human motion. It involves analyzing sensor-recorded data to interpret various human activities, gestures, and behaviors. HAR has applications in healthcare, sports, surveillance, and other domains.HAR relies on techniques such as pose estimation, which determines the position and orientation of a person or object in an image or video by identifying key points or joints. Deep learning approaches, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are commonly used for pose estimation.Data collection for HAR involves using accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors, which capture motion, direction, and location information.

# - The function splits the dataset into training and testing subsets using scikit-learn's `train_test_split`, ensuring the class distribution is maintained with `stratify`.
# - It converts the features and labels into PyTorch tensors, needed for model training in PyTorch.
# - The function creates `TensorDataset` objects for both training and testing data, which are then used to create `DataLoader` objects.
# - `DataLoader` provides an efficient way to iterate through the dataset in batches, crucial for training neural networks efficiently.

PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]
A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]
PyTorch provides two high-level features:[21]

Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system

History[edit]
Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]
PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]

PyTorch tensors[edit]
Main article: Tensor (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]
PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]
Note that the term "tensor" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.

PyTorch neural networks[edit]
Main article: Neural network (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a module called nn (torch.nn) to describe neural networks and to support training. This module offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for neural networks, including various layers and activation functions, enabling the construction of complex models. Networks are built by inheriting from the torch.nn module and defining the sequence of operations in the forward() function. 

Example[edit]
The following program shows the low-level functionality of the library with a simple example.

import torch
dtype = torch.float
device = torch.device("cpu")  # Execute all calculations on the CPU
# device = torch.device("cuda:0")  # Executes all calculations on the GPU

# Create a tensor and fill it with random numbers
a = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(a)
# Output: tensor([[-1.1884,  0.8498, -1.7129],
#                  [-0.8816,  0.1944,  0.5847]])

b = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(b)
# Output: tensor([[ 0.7178, -0.8453, -1.3403],
#                  [ 1.3262,  1.1512, -1.7070]])

print(a * b)
# Output: tensor([[-0.8530, -0.7183,  2.58],
#                  [-1.1692,  0.2238, -0.9981]])

print(a.sum()) 
# Output: tensor(-2.1540)

print(a[1,2]) # Output of the element in the third column of the second row (zero based)
# Output: tensor(0.5847)

print(a.max())
# Output: tensor(0.8498)
The following code-block defines a neural network with linear layers using the nn module.import torch
from torch import nn # Import the nn sub-module from PyTorch

class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):  # Neural networks are defined as classes
    def __init__(self):  # Layers and variables are defined in the __init__ method
        super().__init__()  # Must be in every network.

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

Let’s go through a few flagship examples.Applications of Human Activity Recognition (source)Sports performance analysisHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) can analyze sports performance in various ways. It may be utilized to track and analyze athletes' movements during competition and training, anticipate new injury risks, assess the effectiveness of different training programs, follow individual athletes' growth, and examine team sports' tactical and strategic components. For example, HAR can be used to analyze badminton players' movements during attempting to hit and smash, track runners' movements and identify possible overuse injuries, monitor soccer players' performance during a game, track tennis players' movements throughout a match and identify the areas for enhanced foot movement and positioning, or analyze basketball players' actions during a game to recognize possibilities to improve team defense and ball movement.Keypoint annotations in the V7 toolPro tip: Check out 7 Game-Changing AI Applications in the Sports IndustrySelf-driving carsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) has numerous uses in self-driving cars. HAR may be employed to detect people and other vehicles on the road, increasing the effectiveness and security of self-driving automobiles.

HAR can also recognize driver behavior, such as hand signals and head movements, which can help self-driving cars communicate with human drivers.Pro tip: Check out 9 Revolutionary AI Applications In TransportationHuman/computer interactionHuman Activity Recognition can be used to identify and classify human gestures and movements, which can be utilized to improve computer system usability and accessibility. HAR can be used to enable gesture-based commands of electronic devices like smartphones and smart TVs, resulting in an even more natural and easily understood user interface. HAR can also provide voice-based automation of computer systems, such as virtual personal assistants and chatbots, allowing for more practical and effective communication with computers. Furthermore, HAR can monitor computer users' health and wellness by identifying and categorizing their physical movements and behaviors, which can help prevent and reduce the harmful impacts of prolonged computer use, including eye strain, back pain, etc.GamingHuman Activity Recognition has several uses in the gaming industry. HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models? Check out our collection of 500+ open datasets. Kinetics-700A large, high-quality video dataset of URL links to approximately 650000 Youtube video clips covering 700 human action classes. The videos include human-object interactions, as well as human-human interactions. The Kinetics dataset is great for training human action recognition models.Volleyball action recognition datasetVolleyball is a video action recognition dataset. It has 4830 annotated frames handpicked from 55 videos with nine player action labels and eight team activity labels. It contains group activity annotations as well as individual activity annotations.ARID DatasetThe Action Recognition in the Dark (ARID) dataset is a benchmark dataset for action recognition in low-light conditions. It includes over 3,780 video clips featuring 11 action categories, making it the first dataset focused on human actions in dark videos. The ARID dataset is an important resource for researchers and practitioners working on improving action recognition algorithms in challenging lighting conditions.DAHLIA - Daily Human Life ActivityDAHLIA dataset is focused on human activity recognition for smart-home services, such as user assistance.Videos were recorded in realistic conditions, with 3 Kinect v2 sensors located as they would be in a real context. The long-range activities were performed in an unconstrained way (participants received only a few instructions) and in a continuous (untrimmed) sequence, resulting in long videos (40 min on average per subject).Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data SetThe Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set is a publicly available dataset that contains sensor readings from a smartphone's accelerometer and gyroscope captured during six activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.The dataset includes 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity measurements captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]
A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]
PyTorch provides two high-level features:[21]

Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system

History[edit]
Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]
PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]

PyTorch tensors[edit]
Main article: Tensor (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]
PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]
Note that the term "tensor" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.

PyTorch neural networks[edit]
Main article: Neural network (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a module called nn (torch.nn) to describe neural networks and to support training. This module offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for neural networks, including various layers and activation functions, enabling the construction of complex models. Networks are built by inheriting from the torch.nn module and defining the sequence of operations in the forward() function. 

Example[edit]
The following program shows the low-level functionality of the library with a simple example.

import torch
dtype = torch.float
device = torch.device("cpu")  # Execute all calculations on the CPU
# device = torch.device("cuda:0")  # Executes all calculations on the GPU

# Create a tensor and fill it with random numbers
a = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(a)
# Output: tensor([[-1.1884,  0.8498, -1.7129],
#                  [-0.8816,  0.1944,  0.5847]])

b = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(b)
# Output: tensor([[ 0.7178, -0.8453, -1.3403],
#                  [ 1.3262,  1.1512, -1.7070]])

print(a * b)
# Output: tensor([[-0.8530, -0.7183,  2.58],
#                  [-1.1692,  0.2238, -0.9981]])

print(a.sum()) 
# Output: tensor(-2.1540)

print(a[1,2]) # Output of the element in the third column of the second row (zero based)
# Output: tensor(0.5847)

print(a.max())
# Output: tensor(0.8498)
The following code-block defines a neural network with linear layers using the nn module.import torch
from torch import nn # Import the nn sub-module from PyTorch

class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):  # Neural networks are defined as classes
    def __init__(self):  # Layers and variables are defined in the __init__ method
        super().__init__()  # Must be in every network.
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()   # Construct a flattening layer.
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(  # Construct a stack of layers.
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),  # Linear Layers have an input and output shape
            nn.ReLU(),  # ReLU is one of many activation functions provided by nn
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10), 
        )

    def forward(self, x):  # This function defines the forward pass.
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data. This method is excellent for monitoring actions in public places or when the person being tracked cannot wear a gadget.On-body sensing deployment: Here, the sensors (such as a wrist-wear accelerometer) are worn by the person being observed to capture information about human activities. A HAR model, possibly locally on the smartwatch or a distant computing system, processes the sensor data. This method effectively monitors performance in private locations or when the person being monitored can wear a gadget.Pro tip: Check out our detailed guide to keypoint annotationData labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Data labelingCreate high-quality training datasets with AI-assisted labeling tools and expert annotation services.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Video annotationLabel video footage 10x faster with AI-assisted tracking and segmentation tools.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Medical AIAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Auto-annotation toolsAnnotate medical imaging data across all modalities with specialized tools for healthcare AI development.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Training data managementOrganize and track annotation projects with customizable workflows and quality control features.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Labeling servicesAccess a network of expert annotators with domain expertise across various industries, like healthcare or engineering.Deep neural network models for Human Activity RecognitionHAR is a complex subject for study in the discipline of computer vision. Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.Convolutional Neural NetworksConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning architecture that excels at processing image and video data. CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

HAR, for example, may be utilized to identify and monitor the motions of pedestrians, bicycles, and other automobiles in the environment, allowing self-driving cars to predict and prevent collisions. HAR can also recognize driver behavior, such as hand signals and head movements, which can help self-driving cars communicate with human drivers.Pro tip: Check out 9 Revolutionary AI Applications In TransportationHuman/computer interactionHuman Activity Recognition can be used to identify and classify human gestures and movements, which can be utilized to improve computer system usability and accessibility. HAR can be used to enable gesture-based commands of electronic devices like smartphones and smart TVs, resulting in an even more natural and easily understood user interface. HAR can also provide voice-based automation of computer systems, such as virtual personal assistants and chatbots, allowing for more practical and effective communication with computers. Furthermore, HAR can monitor computer users' health and wellness by identifying and categorizing their physical movements and behaviors, which can help prevent and reduce the harmful impacts of prolonged computer use, including eye strain, back pain, etc.GamingHuman Activity Recognition has several uses in the gaming industry. HAR is capable of helping recognize and classify various player actions and gestures, allowing for more immersive and participatory gaming experiences. For instance, HAR may enable motion-controlled gaming, translating the player's movements and gestures into in-game activities such as swinging a sword or throwing a ball. HAR can also provide gesture-based manipulation of in-game panels and settings, making navigating the game more convenient and intuitive. Furthermore, HAR can track a player's physical exercise and motions while playing. A game, for example, may compensate the player for completing a certain amount of steps or executing a particular workout.Smart surveillanceAs it permits automatic video analysis and interpretation, HAR has become an increasingly relevant tool in smart surveillance. It can improve the protection and security of public areas and vital infrastructure. HAR can recognize and classify human activities like walking, running, loitering, and even suspicious actions such as carrying weapons or goods. This system can detect anomalous or repetitive activity patterns, such as lingering in a closed area or leaving an object unattended, and send notifications to security officers.Furthermore, in real-time, HAR may identify persons, particularly in crowded locations, by assessing their stride, stance, and other physical traits, even if the face is concealed or covered. This system can also follow people throughout the surveillance area, allowing security officers to find and track prospective suspects. However, it presents privacy concerns, which must be handled with suitable legislation and protections.Human Activity Recognition datasetsLet’s review a few of HAR's most important ready-to-use datasets.Pro tip: Looking for quality datasets to train your models?

The sensor data was collected from 30 volunteers wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone on their waist while performing the activities. Each volunteer was asked to perform each activity for approximately 2-3 minutes, resulting in 10,299 instances.Final thoughtsHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an intriguing technology with many applications. HAR recognizes and classifies human activities and movements using machine-learning techniques and sensors. It can transform various sectors, including healthcare, sports performance analysis, gaming, intelligent monitoring, and human/computer interface. Yet, to meet ethical and privacy concerns, the creation and execution of HAR must be done ethically and transparently. It is essential to guarantee that the data utilized to train and assess HAR algorithms is representative, diverse, and unbiased. The article also discussed how deep learning-based HAR approaches outperform conventional algorithms for machine learning, highlighting the outlines of CNN, CNN-LSTM, and RNN.In conclusion,  HAR has the potential to alter our daily lives and have a significant beneficial effect on society as it evolves and improves.

PyTorch is a machine learning library based on the Torch library,[4][5][6] used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing,[7] originally developed by Meta AI and now part of the Linux Foundation umbrella.[8][9][10][11] It is one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, alongside others such as TensorFlow and PaddlePaddle,[12][13] offering free and open-source software released under the modified BSD license. Although the Python interface is more polished and the primary focus of development, PyTorch also has a C++ interface.[14]
A number of pieces of deep learning software are built on top of PyTorch, including Tesla Autopilot,[15] Uber's Pyro,[16] Hugging Face's Transformers,[17][18] and Catalyst.[19][20]
PyTorch provides two high-level features:[21]

Tensor computing (like NumPy) with strong acceleration via graphics processing units (GPU)
Deep neural networks built on a tape-based automatic differentiation system

History[edit]
Meta (formerly known as Facebook) operates both PyTorch and Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (Caffe2), but models defined by the two frameworks were mutually incompatible. The Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) project was created by Meta and Microsoft in September 2017 for converting models between frameworks. Caffe2 was merged into PyTorch at the end of March 2018.[22] In September 2022, Meta announced that PyTorch would be governed by the independent PyTorch Foundation, a newly created subsidiary of the Linux Foundation.[23]
PyTorch 2.0 was released on 15 March 2023, introducing TorchDynamo, a Python-level compiler that makes code run up to 2x faster, along with significant improvements in training and inference performance across major cloud platforms.[24][25]

PyTorch tensors[edit]
Main article: Tensor (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a class called Tensor (torch.Tensor) to store and operate on homogeneous multidimensional rectangular arrays of numbers. PyTorch Tensors are similar to NumPy Arrays, but can also be operated on a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU. PyTorch has also been developing support for other GPU platforms, for example, AMD's ROCm[26] and Apple's Metal Framework.[27]
PyTorch supports various sub-types of Tensors.[28]
Note that the term "tensor" here does not carry the same meaning as tensor in mathematics or physics. The meaning of the word in machine learning is only superficially related to its original meaning as a certain kind of object in linear algebra. Tensors in PyTorch are simply multi-dimensional arrays.

PyTorch neural networks[edit]
Main article: Neural network (machine learning)
PyTorch defines a module called nn (torch.nn) to describe neural networks and to support training. This module offers a comprehensive collection of building blocks for neural networks, including various layers and activation functions, enabling the construction of complex models. Networks are built by inheriting from the torch.nn module and defining the sequence of operations in the forward() function. 

Example[edit]
The following program shows the low-level functionality of the library with a simple example.

import torch
dtype = torch.float
device = torch.device("cpu")  # Execute all calculations on the CPU
# device = torch.device("cuda:0")  # Executes all calculations on the GPU

# Create a tensor and fill it with random numbers
a = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(a)
# Output: tensor([[-1.1884,  0.8498, -1.7129],
#                  [-0.8816,  0.1944,  0.5847]])

b = torch.randn(2, 3, device=device, dtype=dtype)
print(b)
# Output: tensor([[ 0.7178, -0.8453, -1.3403],
#                  [ 1.3262,  1.1512, -1.7070]])

print(a * b)
# Output: tensor([[-0.8530, -0.7183,  2.58],
#                  [-1.1692,  0.2238, -0.9981]])

print(a.sum()) 
# Output: tensor(-2.1540)

print(a[1,2]) # Output of the element in the third column of the second row (zero based)
# Output: tensor(0.5847)

print(a.max())
# Output: tensor(0.8498)
The following code-block defines a neural network with linear layers using the nn module.import torch
from torch import nn # Import the nn sub-module from PyTorch

class NeuralNetwork(nn.Module):  # Neural networks are defined as classes
    def __init__(self):  # Layers and variables are defined in the __init__ method
        super().__init__()  # Must be in every network.
        self.flatten = nn.Flatten()   # Construct a flattening layer.
        self.linear_relu_stack = nn.Sequential(  # Construct a stack of layers.
            nn.Linear(28*28, 512),  # Linear Layers have an input and output shape
            nn.ReLU(),  # ReLU is one of many activation functions provided by nn
            nn.Linear(512, 512),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(512, 10), 
        )

    def forward(self, x):  # This function defines the forward pass.
        x = self.flatten(x)
        logits = self.linear_relu_stack(x)
        return logits

             min read—Mar 27, 2023Dive into the state-of-the-art of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and discover real-life applications plus datasets to try out.Deval ShahGuest AuthorHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) is an exciting research area in computer vision and human-computer interaction.Automatic detection of human physical activity has become crucial in pervasive computing, interpersonal communication, and human behavior analysis.The broad usage of HAR benefits human safety and general well-being. Health monitoring can be done through wearable devices tracking physical activity, heart rate, and sleep quality. In smart homes, HAR-based solutions allow for energy saving and personal comfort by detecting when a person enters or leaves a room and adjusting the lighting or temperature. Personal safety devices can automatically alert emergency services or a designated contact. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. With multiple publicly available datasets, finding ready-to-use data for study and development purposes is very simple.In this post, you’ll learn more about HAR’s current state-of-the-art, along with deep learning methods and machine learning models best suited for the task.Here’s what we’ll cover:What is Human Activity Recognition?How does HAR work?HAR modelsHuman activity recognition applicationsHuman activity recognition datasetsVideo annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin Video annotationAI video annotationGet started todayExplore V7 Darwin And if you're ready to jump straight into labeling data and training your AI models, make sure to check out:V7 AnnotationV7 Model TrainingV7 Dataset ManagementWhat is Human Activity Recognition (HAR)?Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a branch of computational science and engineering that tries to create systems and techniques capable of automatically recognizing and categorizing human actions based on sensor data. It is the capacity to use sensors to interpret human body gestures or motion and determine human activity or movement. HAR systems are typically monitored or unsupervised and can be utilized in various applications, including wellness, athletics, healthcare, security, sports performance, etc.While modeling, the HAR system's objective is to forecast the label of a person's action out of an image or video, which is commonly conducted through video-based activity recognition and image-based activity recognition.Read more: Image Recognition: Definition, Algorithms &amp; UsesPose estimation is used by one of the most common vision-based HAR systems. Researchers employ it more and more frequently as they reveal essential information about human behavior. Pro tip: Check our guide to Human Pose EstimationThis helps in tasks such as HAR, content extraction, semantic comprehension, etc. It makes use of various DL approaches, especially convolutional neural networks. One of HAR’s biggest challenges is taking the physical attributes of humans, cultural markers, direction, and the type of poses into consideration. For example, let’s take a look at the image below. It may be hard to predict whether the person is falling or attempting a handstand. This uncertainty encourages the use newer methods within the artificial intelligence framework.‍Multi-modal learning and graph-based learning aim to improve the accuracy and robustness of HAR systems by incorporating more complex features, utilizing multiple data sources, and capturing the spatial and temporal relationships between body parts.Some of the other HAR challenges include:disparity in sensor data due to gadget placement  movement variationinterference of activities that overlapnoisy data that causes distortionstime-consuming and expensive data collection methodsHow does Human Activity Recognition work? Human Activity Recognition frameworkOne of the critical objects of study in the scientific fields of computer vision and machine learning is the human ability to perceive the activities of others. Here are the basic steps involved in every task.1. Data collectionThe data for HAR is usually acquired by sensors attached to or worn by the user. Standard HAR sensors include accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, and GPS sensors. Accelerometers can detect changes in movement and direction and quantify velocity across three axes (x, y, and z). Magnetometers can sense magnetic fields and order, whereas gyroscopes can measure rotations and angular velocity. GPS sensors are capable of helping track a user's whereabouts and movements, although they are less typically employed for HAR because of their substantial electricity consumption and limited indoor precision. Sensor data is often captured as time-series data, for each sample reflecting sensor measurements at a specific point in time (e.g., every second). 2. Data pre-processingData preprocessing is an essential stage in Human Activity Recognition (HAR) since it cleans, transforms, and prepares raw sensor data for future analysis and modeling. Some standard preparation processes include:Filtering: Filtering is a signal processing technique for removing noise and undesirable signals from raw sensor data. Depending on the frequency range of the signs of interest, typical filters used during HAR include low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and band-pass filters for noise suppression and image enhancement.Feature extraction: The features used are determined by the type of action and the sensor modality. Accelerometer data, for example, can be used to extract features such as mean, standard deviation, and frequency-domain properties, such as Fourier transformation and wavelet transformation parameters.Feature selection: The process of selecting features is used to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and increase the precision and effectiveness of activity identification algorithms. This entails deciding on the most relevant characteristics based on their exclusionary ability, association with activity labeling, and redundancies with other features.Segmentation: To extract the temporal aspects of the activities, segmentation requires separating the sensor information into more compact segments or windows. The size and overlap of the window are determined by the duration and intensity of the activity being watched. After that, the segmented data is used to compute the characteristics of each window.Normalization: Normalization is the process of scaling features to have a neutral mean and variance of 1 to guarantee that they are similar across sensors and participants.Dimensionality reduction: Principal component analysis (PCA) and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) are dimensionality reduction techniques that have the potential to minimize the feature space's degree of dimensionality and remove redundant or irrelevant features.Missing Value Imputation: Imputation is about filling in incomplete sensor data. The incompletion may happen due to device malfunction or data transmission faults. Simple imputation approaches can be utilized for missing values, including mean or median interpolation.Data preparation is a crucial stage in HAR since it affects the precision and dependability of activity identification models. 3. Model selectionSeveral machine learning algorithms may be used to recognize human activities. The choice should depend on data complexity, available resources, and performance criteria. Here are some popular HAR machine learning models:Decision trees: Decision tree algorithms are straightforward models that deal with non-linear interactions among features and labels. They can be used for classification tasks in Human Activity Recognition based on sensor data such as accelerometers or gyroscope readings. Decision trees are easy to interpret and can handle both continuous and categorical data, making them useful for gaining insights into the most important features of a given classification task. However, they may suffer from overfitting and fall short in scenarios where the input data is highly complex or noisy.Random forest: Random forests are decision tree ensembles that can manage noisy and high-dimensional data. They resist overfitting and can deal with missing values. On the other hand, random forests may take more computational resources than decision trees and might need to perform better on tiny datasets.Support Vector Machines: SVMs are robust models that deal with nonlinear and linear data. They can deal with high-dimensional data while being less susceptible to overfitting. However, they may need careful hyperparameter tweaking and can be computationally costly with massive datasets.Hidden Markov Models: HMM is a statistical model used in HAR to recognize sequential patterns in sensor input. HMMs are very useful for time-series data and may be effective for complex activities with several steps.Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning algorithms well-suited for picture and time-series data, such as gyroscope and accelerometer data. These algorithms can efficiently handle hierarchical features from raw data and manage complex data patterns but may need more computation power than other models and are prone to overfitting.Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are deep learning models that handle sequential data such as time series. They can deal with variable-length sequences and detect temporal connections in data. However, they may struggle with the vanishing gradient issue and require careful initialization and regularization.4. Model deploymentHuman Activity Recognition (HAR) systems are deployed using one of two methods:External sensing deployment: In this method, external sensors (including cameras or motion detectors) are placed in the surroundings to collect information on human activities. A HAR model running on a different computing machine processes the sensor data.

Researchers worldwide have been working on constructing a near-perfect recognition system for a long time.For example, a paper by J. Gao et al. compares the performance of deep learning algorithms (such as Convolutional Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks) to classical machine learning methods (such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forests) in HAR tasks. The study finds that deep learning algorithms outperform classical machine learning methods in terms of accuracy, robustness to variations in sensor data, and the ability to learn complex features automatically from raw data. The study also notes that deep learning algorithms can be computationally efficient and implemented on low-power devices for real-time HAR applications.DL models can accommodate fluctuations in sensor placement, inclination, and other environmental conditions that alter sensor signals, making them more resilient to real-world circumstances. DL models are also extensible and capable of handling big datasets containing millions of observations, which is especially beneficial for HAR applications involving several sensors and supports multiple users.Besides this, deep learning algorithms excel in processing time-series data to classify and extract features, leveraging local dependencies. Researchers are increasingly interested in using sophisticated deep learning approaches such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and hybrid models to recognize human activities better.Furthermore, DL models can develop end-to-end models that map sensor data directly to activity labels, eliminating the need for intermediate processes like segmentation and extraction of features.Recurrent Neural NetworksRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a form of deep learning model that works well with sequential input, particularly in Human Activity Recognition situations where the input data is time-series data from sensors. The input data is initially turned into a sequence of fixed-length feature vectors in HAR using RNNs, with each vector indicating a time window of sensor data. The feature vector sequence is then passed into the RNN, which successively examines each input vector while keeping a hidden state that retains the temporal connections between input vectors.The ability of RNNs to detect long-term temporal dependencies in input data is their primary benefit for HAR. This is performed by employing recurrent connections between the RNN's hidden states. The recurrent connections let the RNN keep an internal recollection of prior inputs, which helps it recognize complicated patterns of activity that span numerous time frames.RNNs have demonstrated encouraging results in HAR, with excellent precision and durability in recognizing complicated operations, such as athletic movements, home activities, and fall detection. It can also handle variable-length input sequences, making them well enough for practical uses where activity duration varies. The limitations include disappearing and exploding gradient problem, which can impact the training process.Long Short-Term MemoryLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR). LSTM models, like other RNNs, are designed to analyze data sequences and save internal memories of prior inputs, enabling them to retain the temporal connections between different sections of the sequence. The main benefit of LSTMs over all other RNNs is their capacity to forget or retain information from previous time steps consciously. This aids in solving the issue of vanishing gradients, which frequently occur in regular RNNs. LSTMs can effectively simulate long-term dependencies inside the input sequence. They’re well-suited for complicated HAR tasks such as identifying anomalies and recognizing complex human actions.LSTM-based models demonstrated significant gains in HAR tasks in various benchmark datasets, attaining state-of-the-art performance. They have also shown resilience in detecting complicated activities and dealing with variable-length input sequences. However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.RNN-LSTM basic outline Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a form of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) which has been effectively used for a variety of sequential data-related tasks, including Human Activity Recognition (HAR).

However, just like other models based on deep learning, LSTMs have several drawbacks for HAR: the requirement for vast volumes of labeled data, computational cost, and model interpretability.Convolutional Neural NetworksConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a deep learning architecture that excels at processing image and video data. CNNs have been utilized in the setting of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) to automatically and reliably detect and classify human actions from sensor data.The input data for HAR utilizing CNNs is often time-series data acquired by sensors. The time-series data is first transformed into a 2D image-like format, with time as the x-axis and sensor data as the y-axis.The generated data matrix is then input into the CNN for the extraction and classification of features. Using a sliding window technique, CNN's convolutional layers apply filters to the incoming data. At different points in the input data, each filter takes a certain feature from it, including edges or corners. The result of the convolutional layers is then passed into the pooling layers, which downsample the retrieved features while maintaining their crucial spatial correlations. The pooling layers' output is then smoothed and passed into fully connected layers that classify the retrieved features into distinct human activities. The output of the fully linked layers is then fed into a softmax function, which generates a probability distribution over the various activities.The image below, taken from this paper, gives us an idea of how CNN’s basic framework works.CNN basic outlineCNNs have the advantage of handling input information of different sizes and forms, making them well enough to interpret sensor data from various devices. Furthermore, CNNs may learn hierarchical feature representations of data input, allowing them to acquire low-level and high-level elements essential to human activity identification.Pro tip: Looking for a source to recap activation functions?

In this correction, the `extract_features` function has been updated to ensure that each feature entry has the same size by flattening the FFT coefficients and selecting a fixed number of coefficients. The error in the previous code was due to the variable length of FFT coefficients for each axis. Now, by flattening and taking the first 40 coefficients for each axis, we ensure the output array has a homogeneous shape. The rest of the code remains unchanged.</span>

- The program initializes with a warning related to CUDA, indicating potential compatibility issues with the hardware. This warning is not critical to the functionality but should be noted for hardware compatibility.
- The training process shows a steady decrease in loss and an increase in accuracy over 10 epochs.
- The final average recognition accuracy on the test dataset is 0.95, which exceeds the user's target of 0.90.

Since the program already meets and exceeds the user's requirement for recognition accuracy, improving the system further may involve enhancing the robustness of the model, reducing overfitting, or improving computational efficiency. However, given the already high accuracy, the focus might be on maintaining or slightly improving accuracy while reducing complexity or execution time.

To modify the high-level design with more advanced algorithms for human activity recognition using accelerometer data, the following steps can be taken:

Step 1: Explore Advanced Feature Engineering
- Investigate more sophisticated time and frequency domain features that could enhance model performance, such as wavelet transforms or additional statistical features.

Step 2: Enhance Model Architecture
- Based on recent research, consider using advanced deep learning architectures such as attention-based models or graph neural networks that can capture complex relationships in time-series data.

Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization
- Use techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, number of layers, and dropout rate to find the best model configuration.

Step 4: Data Augmentation
- To improve the model's ability to generalize and to prevent overfitting, implement data augmentation techniques for time-series data, such as jittering, scaling, and rotations, which can simulate variations in human activities.

Step 5: Ensemble Methods
- Explore ensemble methods that combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy. Techniques like model averaging, stacking, or boosting can be effective.

Step 6: Transfer Learning
- If additional labeled datasets are available, consider using transfer learning to pre-train the model on one dataset and fine-tune it on the WISDM dataset to leverage knowledge from related tasks.

The above steps can be integrated into the existing design to potentially improve the accuracy further or to enhance other aspects of the human activity recognition system, such as robustness and generalization.</span>

- Investigate spectral features extraction methods inspired by audio processing, such as using the Fourier Transform to create signal images from time-series segments for accelerometer data.
- Explore unsupervised machine learning techniques for feature selection to identify the most relevant features for physical activity recognition.

Step 2: Enhanced Model Architecture
- Consider utilizing deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for automatic feature extraction from raw accelerometer data.
- Look into implementing Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to capture temporal dependencies in the data.
- Research attention mechanisms that can be integrated with RNNs or LSTMs to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequence for activity recognition.

Step 3: Hyperparameter Optimization
- Employ methods like grid search, random search, or Bayesian optimization to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimal settings for the network architecture.
- Analyze the impact of different activation functions, kernel sizes, and the number of layers on the model's performance.

Step 4: Data Augmentation
- Apply data augmentation techniques to the time-series accelerometer data to increase the diversity of the training set, such as random rotations, scaling, and adding random noise.
- Use window slicing with varying sizes and overlaps to generate additional training samples from the time-series data.

Step 5: Ensemble Methods
- Implement ensemble learning techniques, such as bagging, boosting, or stacking, to combine the predictions from multiple models or model configurations to improve the final accuracy.
- Evaluate the performance of various ensemble methods and choose the best approach based on validation results.

Step 6: Transfer Learning
- If external datasets are available, pre-train the model on these datasets and fine-tune the pre-trained network on the WISDM dataset.
- Explore the use of pre-trained models from related domains as feature extractors, followed by a custom classification layer trained on the WISDM dataset.

Each of these steps should be explored and tested to determine their impact on the recognition accuracy of the human activity recognition system. The implementation should be guided by the results of experiments and validations on the WISDM dataset.</span>

The provided code defines a function for augmenting time-series accelerometer data to increase the training set's diversity. Augmentation techniques include random rotations, scaling, and adding noise, which are common transformations for data augmentation in time-series data. The function `augment_data` applies these augmentations to each data segment and retains the corresponding labels. Each augmentation function is designed to simulate realistic variations in the data. This data augmentation can help improve the machine learning model's robustness and generalization to unseen data.</span>

# - The function uses separate DataLoaders for the pre-training and fine-tuning phases to handle different datasets.
# - Pre-training and fine-tuning have separate epoch counts, which can be adjusted based on the size and complexity of the datasets.
# - The model is returned after fine-tuning, ready for evaluation or deployment.
```

The provided code implements the transfer learning step by pre-training a neural network model on an external dataset and then fine-tuning it on the target WISDM dataset. The function `transfer_learning` takes a model, pretraining and target datasets, the device to use for training, and the number of epochs for pre-training and fine-tuning. It updates the model's weights through both phases and returns the fine-tuned model. This approach is intended to leverage knowledge from related tasks to improve the model's performance on the target task. The example usage assumes that the model class `EnhancedHARModel` and datasets `pretrain_dataset` and `target_dataset` are already defined and prepared.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Analyzing and summarizing the program output:

1. The program output begins with a warning related to CUDA initialization, indicating potential hardware compatibility issues. This warning does not impact the functionality of the code but suggests that there might be a problem with CUDA compatibility on the hardware being used.

2. The output then displays the average recognition accuracy for multiple runs or epochs of the system. The accuracies range from 0.83 to 0.93, with the later runs achieving the target accuracy of 0.90 and above.

3. The accuracy appears to improve over successive runs, which may indicate that the model is learning effectively across epochs.

Based on the summarized output, the program meets the user's requirement of an average recognition accuracy of 0.90, with some runs achieving even higher accuracy. However, since the goal is to improve the detection/recognition accuracy across all cases, we can consider the following modifications to the high-level design to further enhance the system:

Modified High-Level Design:

Step 1: Advanced Preprocessing Techniques
- Incorporate signal denoising techniques like wavelet transforms to clean the raw accelerometer data before feature extraction.
- Use dynamic time warping as a preprocessing step to align time-series data, which can be beneficial for activity recognition.

Step 2: Enhanced Feature Extraction
- Explore additional time-frequency analysis methods such as Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) or Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) to capture more granular features from the accelerometer data.

Step 3: Improved Model Architecture
- Investigate the integration of more sophisticated deep learning architectures such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs) or Transformers that have shown promising results in sequence modeling tasks.

Step 4: Advanced Hyperparameter Tuning
- Apply more systematic hyperparameter optimization methods like Bayesian optimization, which can be more efficient than grid search, especially in high-dimensional spaces.

Step 5: Robust Data Augmentation
- Implement advanced data augmentation techniques such as synthetic minority over-sampling (SMOTE) for time-series data to address class imbalance issues.
- Explore adaptive data augmentation strategies that modify the augmentation parameters based on the model's learning progress.

Step 6: Ensemble and Transfer Learning
- Utilize a diverse set of models in the ensemble, including those trained with different feature sets and architectures, to increase the robustness of predictions.
- Leverage transfer learning from multiple pre-trained models, potentially from different but related tasks or domains, to enrich the feature space.

Step 7: Post-Processing of Model Predictions
- Implement a decision smoothing technique, such as a majority vote over a sliding window of predictions, to reduce the impact of sporadic misclassifications.
- Explore the use of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) for post-processing to incorporate transition probabilities between activities for more accurate sequence predictions.

By integrating these advanced algorithms and techniques, the human activity recognition system can be further improved, potentially leading to higher accuracy and better generalization across all cases.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Step 1: Advanced Signal Denoising
- Implement wavelet-based denoising techniques to remove noise while preserving the important features of the accelerometer data.
- Explore adaptive filtering methods that can be tailored to the specific noise characteristics of the accelerometer data.

Step 2: Time-Series Alignment
- Apply dynamic time warping (DTW) to align time-series data from different sessions, enhancing the model's ability to recognize similar activities with temporal variations.

Step 3: Time-Frequency Feature Extraction
- Utilize Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) to extract time-frequency representations of the accelerometer data, capturing both temporal and spectral information.
- Incorporate Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) for a multi-resolution analysis of the accelerometer signals, allowing the capture of features at various frequencies and scales.

Step 4: Sophisticated Model Architectures
- Research and implement Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), which are specifically designed for sequence modeling tasks and can handle long-range dependencies.
- Experiment with Transformer-based models that use self-attention mechanisms to weigh different parts of the input sequence, potentially leading to better activity recognition.

Step 5: Systematic Hyperparameter Optimization
- Employ Bayesian optimization techniques to efficiently search the hyperparameter space, potentially finding better configurations with fewer iterations.

Step 6: Class Imbalance and Data Augmentation
- Implement Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) for time-series data to generate synthetic examples for underrepresented classes.
- Introduce adaptive data augmentation strategies that can vary augmentation intensity based on the model's current state and performance.

Step 7: Ensemble Techniques
- Develop a diverse ensemble of models with different architectures and feature sets, and use methods such as weighted averaging or stacking to combine their predictions.

Step 8: Transfer Learning from Multiple Sources
- Apply transfer learning from various pre-trained models, possibly from different related tasks, to enrich the feature representation of the accelerometer data.

Step 9: Post-Processing for Smooth Predictions
- Implement decision smoothing using a sliding window majority vote to reduce the impact of sporadic misclassifications in the predictions.
- Consider the use of probabilistic graphical models such as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) or Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to model the transitions between activities and refine the sequence of predicted activities.

These steps aim to enhance the human activity recognition system by incorporating advanced signal processing techniques, sophisticated deep learning architectures, and smart strategies for handling imbalanced data and making smooth predictions. Each step focuses on improving a specific aspect of the system, from preprocessing to post-processing, to achieve higher accuracy and robustness in activity recognition.</span>

# - Wavelet decomposition is performed on the input signal to obtain the detail coefficients.
# - A threshold is calculated to determine the level of detail coefficients to be set to zero, effectively removing noise.

# - The wavelet type and level of decomposition are parameters that can be adjusted based on the noise characteristics of the data.
# - This function can be applied to each axis of the accelerometer data to improve the overall signal quality for feature extraction and activity recognition.
```

The provided code implements a wavelet-based denoising technique for accelerometer data segments. It performs a wavelet decomposition, estimates the noise level, applies a soft threshold to the detail coefficients for noise reduction, and then reconstructs the denoised signal. The function is designed to be applied to each axis of the accelerometer data independently. The `wavelet` and `level` parameters can be adjusted to tailor the denoising process to the specific characteristics of the data. This preprocessing step can enhance the quality of the features extracted for the activity recognition model.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">I'm sorry, but I'm unable to access external packages that are not installed with pip or to search the web for additional information on dynamic time warping (DTW) or similar algorithms. 

However, dynamic time warping is a well-known algorithm in the field of time-series analysis and is often used in speech recognition, bioinformatics, and activity recognition to measure the similarity between two temporal sequences that may vary in speed. 

For instance, if you were to implement DTW, you would typically need a function that takes two sequences as input and outputs a measure of their similarity, accounting for possible time shifts. If you have access to a Python environment, you can use the `fastdtw` package, which is an approximate DTW algorithm that provides faster computation while achieving results comparable to the standard DTW algorithm. To install `fastdtw`, you can use the command `pip install fastdtw`.

Below is a hypothetical code implementation of how to use DTW for aligning time-series data:

```python
from fastdtw import fastdtw
from scipy.spatial.distance import euclidean

def align_time_series(reference_segment, target_segment):
    """
    Align a target time-series segment to a reference segment using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW).
    
    Parameters:
    - reference_segment: np.array, the reference accelerometer data segment for alignment.
    - target_segment: np.array, the target accelerometer data segment to align.
    
    Returns:
    - distance: float, the DTW distance between the aligned segments.
    - aligned_segment: np.array, the aligned target segment.
    """
    distance, path = fastdtw(reference_segment, target_segment, dist=euclidean)
    aligned_segment = np.array([target_segment[i] for _, i in path])
    
    return distance, aligned_segment

# Example usage:
# Assuming `reference_segment` and `target_segment` are numpy arrays representing two time-series segments
distance, aligned_segment = align_time_series(reference_segment, target_segment)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function `align_time_series` uses the `fastdtw` package to compute a DTW alignment between two time-series segments.
# - The `fastdtw` function returns the DTW distance and the optimal alignment path between the two segments.
# - The `aligned_segment` is constructed by ordering the target segment according to the alignment path.
# - This function can be used to align segments from different sessions or subjects, enhancing the model's ability to recognize similar activities with temporal variations.
```

Please note that the `fastdtw` package is required for this code to run, and the `euclidean` function from `scipy.spatial.distance` is used as the distance metric for DTW. The actual alignment of the data would depend on further processing of the path returned by `fastdtw`.</span>

Here's an example of how you might structure such a function:

    stft_features = np.abs(Zxx)  # Get the magnitude of the STFT coefficients

    # Apply Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)

    coefficients, frequencies = pywt.cwt(signal, scales, wavelet, sampling_period=1/fs)
    cwt_features = np.abs(coefficients)  # Get the magnitude of the CWT coefficients

    return stft_features, cwt_features

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'data' is a numpy array containing accelerometer data and 'fs' is the sampling frequency
stft_features, cwt_features = extract_time_frequency_features(data, fs=50)  # Example usage with a sampling frequency of 50Hz

# Explanations of the code:
# - This function provides a way to extract both temporal and spectral features from a time-series signal using STFT and CWT.
# - The STFT is computed using a Hann window with specified segment length, overlap, and FFT points.
# - The CWT is computed using the specified wavelet and scales.
# - Both STFT and CWT return complex coefficients; the magnitudes of these coefficients are used as features.
# - The function can be applied to each axis of the accelerometer data independently or to a preprocessed version of the signal.
```
Please note that the above code requires the `scipy` and `PyWavelets` (or `pywt`) libraries. If these libraries are not already installed in your Python environment, you can install them using pip:

```sh
pip install scipy
pip install PyWavelets
```

The function `extract_time_frequency_features` will take a signal (e.g., from an accelerometer axis), perform STFT and CWT, and return the magnitude of the coefficients from both transforms as features.</span>

Please note, the `PositionalEncoding` and `TransformerModel` classes are based on the PyTorch transformer tutorial. They include the necessary components to build a transformer model, including the positional encoding layer which is crucial for the model to understand the order of the sequence. The `TemporalConvNet` and `TemporalBlock` classes define a simple TCN architecture with dilated convolutions, which are particularly good for capturing long-range dependencies in sequential data. These models can be trained and evaluated on the WISDM dataset as part of a human activity recognition system.</span>

# - The `train_and_evaluate_model` function is a placeholder for the actual training and evaluation of the model.
# - The `objective_func` function wraps the training and evaluation process so it can be passed to the optimizer.
# - The `bounds` dictionary defines the search space for the hyperparameters.
# - This code assumes you have a training function and dataset ready to be used.
# - In a real-world scenario, you would replace the placeholder functions with actual code that performs Bayesian optimization and training.
```

In practice, you would use a Bayesian optimization library to handle the optimization process, and you would replace the placeholder training function with your actual training loop and model evaluation code. The optimizer would iterate over the hyperparameter space, guided by a Gaussian Process (or similar model) to find the hyperparameters that minimize the objective function, which, in this case, is the negative accuracy of the model on the validation set.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Implementing Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) from scratch can be quite complex, and it is typically done with the help of libraries like `imbalanced-learn` which cannot be used here as per the rules. However, I can provide a high-level pseudocode-style implementation that outlines how you might go about implementing SMOTE for time-series data, along with a simple adaptive data augmentation strategy.

```python
import numpy as np

def smote_time_series(data, labels, minority_class, k_neighbors=5, oversampling_rate=1.0):
    """
    Apply SMOTE to time-series data for class imbalance by generating synthetic examples for the minority class.

    Parameters:
    - data: np.array, the feature dataset.
    - labels: np.array, the corresponding labels for the dataset.
    - minority_class: int, the label of the minority class.
    - k_neighbors: int, the number of nearest neighbors to consider for generating synthetic data.
    - oversampling_rate: float, the rate of oversampling for the minority class.

    Returns:
    - synthetic_data: np.array, the synthetic samples generated for the minority class.
    - synthetic_labels: np.array, the labels for the synthetic samples.
    """

    # Identify the minority class samples
    minority_data = data[labels == minority_class]
    
    # TODO: Find k nearest neighbors for each minority sample
    # This could be done using a time-series specific distance metric
    
    # TODO: Generate synthetic samples by interpolation between minority samples and their neighbors
    # For each sample in the minority class:
    #   Randomly choose one of its k neighbors
    #   Generate a synthetic sample by interpolation between the sample and its neighbor

    # Placeholder for synthetic samples (to be generated by the actual implementation)
    synthetic_data = np.zeros((int(len(minority_data) * oversampling_rate), data.shape[1]))

    - augmentation_strategy: callable, the augmentation function to apply to the data.
    - performance_threshold: float, the performance threshold to adjust the augmentation intensity.

    # Apply the augmentation strategy with the determined intensity
    augmented_data = augmentation_strategy(data, intensity=augmentation_intensity)
    augmented_labels = labels  # Labels remain unchanged

    return augmented_data, augmented_labels

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function `smote_time_series` is a high-level representation of the SMOTE algorithm applied to time-series data.
# - It requires the implementation of nearest neighbors finding and synthetic sample generation specific to time-series data.
# - The function `adaptive_augmentation` adjusts the intensity of data augmentation based on the current performance of the model.
# - If the model's performance is below a certain threshold, the augmentation intensity is increased to generate more varied samples.
# - Both functions are designed to address class imbalance and improve the robustness of the human activity recognition system.
```

Please note that the actual implementation of SMOTE for time-series data would require calculating the similarity between time-series instances, which is not trivial and could involve complex distance measures. The adaptive augmentation function is a conceptual placeholder that would adjust the intensity of a given augmentation strategy based on the current performance of the model.

The above code is meant to provide a high-level structure and should be filled in with actual logic for finding nearest neighbors and generating synthetic samples for SMOTE, as well as applying an augmentation strategy with varying intensity for adaptive augmentation.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">The following Python code defines a function to create an ensemble of different neural network models for human activity recognition. Each model makes predictions on the test dataset, and the predictions are combined using a simple average (an example of weighted averaging where all weights are equal). This ensemble method can be extended to include more sophisticated combination methods, such as stacking or using a meta-learner.

ensemble_labels = np.argmax(ensemble_predictions, axis=1)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function 'create_ensemble' takes a list of trained models and a test dataset to make predictions.
# - For each model, we iterate over the test data using a DataLoader and collect the predictions.
# - The predictions from each model are stored in a list and then averaged to obtain the final ensemble prediction.
# - This ensemble approach can be beneficial when the models have different strengths and can complement each other's predictions.
# - The example assumes that the necessary data preprocessing has been done and the models have been trained beforehand.
```

Please note that the actual implementation would involve training the individual models before creating the ensemble. The ensemble function provided assumes that the models are already trained and ready to make predictions. The function averages the predictions made by each model on the test dataset to produce the final ensemble prediction. This method can potentially improve the overall performance by leveraging the strengths of multiple models.</span>

model = transfer_learning_from_multiple_sources(base_models, train_dataset, test_dataset, num_classes=6, device=device)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The class `TransferLearningModel` initializes with pre-trained base models and a new classifier.
# - The function `transfer_learning_from_multiple_sources` performs transfer learning by training a new classifier on top of the features extracted by the pre-trained models.
# - The training loop freezes the parameters of the pre-trained models and only updates the weights of the classifier.
# - This approach leverages the feature representation ability of the pre-trained models to improve performance on the target task.
```

In this example, `TransferLearningModel` is a custom model that uses multiple pre-trained models as feature extractors. These models are frozen during training, meaning their weights are not updated. Only the classifier's parameters are trained. The `transfer_learning_from_multiple_sources` function manages the training and evaluation process. It assumes that the pre-trained models have a property `fc` that gives access to the final fully connected layer, which is typical for models like ResNet.

Please adjust the code to fit the actual structure of your pre-trained models and dataset. This example assumes that the pre-trained models are compatible with your data and that you have a way to load your data into `train_dataset` and `test_dataset` variables.</span>

<span class="ansi-bold">&gt; Entering new AgentExecutor chain...</span>
<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Given the constraints outlined, I will provide a Python function that implements a simple decision smoothing technique using a sliding window majority vote, without the use of any external packages that cannot be installed with pip. This function assumes predictions are made for each time step and aims to smooth these predictions over a defined window size. The function does not implement probabilistic graphical models like HMMs or CRFs, as these would typically require external libraries.

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import mode

def smooth_predictions(predictions, window_size=5):
    """

    - window_size: int, the size of the sliding window to use for the majority vote.

    Returns:
    - smoothed_predictions: np.array, the sequence of smoothed predictions.
    """
    # Pad the predictions array with the mode of the predictions at the start and end
    pad_width = window_size // 2
    pad_value = mode(predictions).mode[0]
    padded_predictions = np.pad(predictions, pad_width, mode='constant', constant_values=pad_value)
    
    # Apply sliding window majority vote
    smoothed_predictions = np.empty_like(predictions)
    for i in range(len(predictions)):
        window = padded_predictions[i:i + window_size]
        window_mode = mode(window).mode[0]
        smoothed_predictions[i] = window_mode
    
    return smoothed_predictions

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'raw_predictions' contains the raw predictions from the model for each time step
window_size = 5  # Define an odd number to have a central element in the window
smoothed_predictions = smooth_predictions(raw_predictions, window_size)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function 'smooth_predictions' takes a sequence of raw predictions and applies a sliding window majority vote to smooth the predictions.
# - The 'predictions' array is padded at the beginning and end to handle edge cases where the window would extend beyond the array bounds.
# - For each element in the 'predictions' array, a window of size 'window_size' is used to determine the majority vote which becomes the smoothed prediction at that point.
# - The function returns the smoothed predictions, which should have reduced the impact of sporadic misclassifications.
```

This code provides a post-processing step that can be applied after obtaining the raw predictions from the model. The decision smoothing technique is model-agnostic and can be used with any classifier output. It can help to reduce the noise in the predictions especially in scenarios where activities can be misclassified for short durations due to the transitional movements between different activities.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Analyzing the program output:

1. The first line of the output indicates a warning related to CUDA initialization. This suggests a potential compatibility issue with the hardware or a previous error in the CUDA environment. This warning does not directly impact the functionality of the code but may be indicative of deeper issues with CUDA on the system.

2. The average recognition accuracy starts at 0.73 and shows gradual improvement over successive runs, plateauing at around 0.80 to 0.81. Notably, the accuracy does not meet the target accuracy of 0.90 specified in the user's problem statement.

Summarizing the program output:

- The human activity recognition system is not achieving the desired accuracy level of 0.90 as mentioned in the user's requirements.
- The accuracy improves slightly with more training (as seen in the increment from 0.73 to 0.81), but it reaches a plateau, indicating that the current model and training strategy may not be sufficient to achieve the target accuracy.

To improve the detection/recognition accuracy across all cases, we can consider the following modifications to the high-level design:

Step 1: Enhanced Data Preprocessing
- Investigate advanced signal processing techniques that may help in extracting more informative features from the raw accelerometer data, such as band-pass filtering to remove noise outside the range of human movement frequencies.

Step 2: Refined Feature Engineering
- Incorporate additional hand-crafted features that have proven useful in activity recognition, such as signal magnitude area (SMA), signal vector magnitude (SVM), and autoregressive coefficients.
- Implement advanced feature extraction methods like wavelet transform to capture both frequency and time information.

Step 3: Deep Learning Architectures
- Research and implement more complex neural network architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) that are well-suited for time-series data.
- Explore the integration of attention mechanisms to allow the model to focus on the most relevant parts of the input sequences.

Step 4: Model Training Enhancements
- Apply techniques like transfer learning, where a model pre-trained on a large and relevant dataset is fine-tuned on the WISDM dataset to improve performance.
- Utilize regularization techniques such as dropout and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

Step 5: Post-Training Optimization
- Implement ensemble methods, combining predictions from multiple models or model configurations to improve overall accuracy.
- Explore the use of semi-supervised or unsupervised learning approaches to leverage unlabeled data, if available.

Step 6: Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning
- Use cross-validation to more robustly evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting to the test data.
- Employ hyperparameter optimization techniques like grid search or Bayesian optimization to systematically explore the hyperparameter space and find the optimal settings.

By integrating these modifications, the human activity recognition system can potentially achieve higher accuracy in detecting and recognizing activities. Each step aims to enhance different aspects of the machine learning pipeline, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">Step 1: Advanced Signal Processing for Data Preprocessing
- Apply band-pass filters to the raw accelerometer data to retain frequencies that are characteristic of human activities while removing noise.
- Utilize signal normalization techniques to ensure the data across all sensors has a consistent scale.

Step 2: Comprehensive Feature Extraction
- Extract hand-crafted features such as signal magnitude area (SMA), signal vector magnitude (SVM), and autoregressive model coefficients that are known to be effective for activity recognition.
- Use wavelet transforms to decompose accelerometer signals into time-frequency space, capturing detailed information that can be used as features.

Step 3: Implementation of Complex Neural Network Architectures
- Construct Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically extract spatial features from segmented accelerometer data.
- Employ Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to capture temporal dependencies and dynamics in the time-series data.
- Integrate attention mechanisms within RNNs to allow the model to focus on the most informative segments of the input sequence.

Step 4: Robust Model Training Strategies
- Leverage transfer learning by using models pre-trained on large, relevant datasets and fine-tuning them on the WISDM dataset.
- Include regularization methods like dropout layers within the neural network architecture to prevent overfitting, and consider implementing early stopping during training.

Step 5: Post-Training Model Optimization
- Utilize ensemble learning techniques, such as model averaging or stacking, to combine predictions from various models or different configurations of the same model.
- Explore semi-supervised learning to utilize any available unlabeled data, which can be particularly helpful when labeled data is scarce.

Step 6: Hyperparameter Optimization and Model Evaluation
- Perform k-fold cross-validation to assess model generalizability and ensure robust performance evaluation.
- Optimize model hyperparameters systematically by using grid search or Bayesian optimization to find the best combination of parameters for model training.

By following these steps and integrating the mentioned technologies and algorithms, the human activity recognition system's performance should improve, potentially achieving or surpassing the target average recognition accuracy of 0.90. Each step aims to enhance the system's ability to process and learn from the accelerometer data effectively.</span>

This code provides a preprocessing function that applies a band-pass filter to raw accelerometer data to remove noise outside the range of human activities and normalize the data scales across all sensors. The band-pass filter is designed using a third-order Butterworth filter, known for its flat frequency response in the passband. The function is intended to be used before feature extraction and model training to improve the quality of input data for the human activity recognition system.</span>

<span class="ansi-green-intense-fg ansi-bold">To implement comprehensive feature extraction, we can create a function that calculates hand-crafted features from time-series accelerometer data, such as Signal Magnitude Area (SMA), Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM), and autoregressive coefficients. Additionally, we can use a wavelet transform to extract time-frequency features. Here's how you might structure such a Python function:

```python
import numpy as np

from scipy.signal import find_peaks
from statsmodels.tsa.ar_model import AutoReg

def extract_features(segment, sampling_rate):

    - sampling_rate: int, the sampling rate of the accelerometer data.

    Returns:
    - features: np.array, extracted features from the segment.
    """
    # Calculate Signal Magnitude Area (SMA)
    sma = np.sum(np.abs(segment), axis=0)

    # Calculate Signal Vector Magnitude (SVM)
    svm = np.sqrt(np.sum(np.square(segment), axis=1))

    # Find peaks in the SVM signal
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(svm, height=np.mean(svm))

    # Calculate the number of peaks as a feature
    num_peaks = len(peaks)

    # Use a real FFT to get frequency domain features
    fft_coefs = rfft(segment, axis=0)
    fft_features = np.abs(fft_coefs)

    # Calculate autoregressive coefficients for each axis
    ar_coefs = []
    for axis in range(segment.shape[1]):
        model = AutoReg(segment[:, axis], lags=4, old_names=False)
        model_fit = model.fit()
        ar_coefs.extend(model_fit.params)

    # Combine all features into a single array
    features = np.concatenate([sma, [num_peaks], fft_features.flatten(), ar_coefs])

    return features

# Example usage:
# Assuming 'data_segment' is a numpy array containing a segment of accelerometer data
# and 'sampling_rate' is an integer representing the rate at which the data was sampled
sampling_rate = 50  # Example: 50 Hz
extracted_features = extract_features(data_segment, sampling_rate)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function 'extract_features' calculates both time-domain and frequency-domain features from accelerometer data.
# - SMA is computed as the sum of the absolute values across each axis within the segment.
# - SVM is the square root of the sum of squares of the acceleration values across axes.
# - The number of peaks in SVM can indicate the intensity of physical activity.
# - The FFT is applied to each axis to transform the signal into the frequency domain, capturing dominant frequencies.
# - Autoregressive coefficients act as features representing the time-series prediction capabilities of the segment.
# - All extracted features are concatenated into a single feature vector to be used for training machine learning models.
```

Please note that this code snippet uses `scipy.fftpack.rfft` for the real Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), `scipy.signal.find_peaks` to detect peaks in the SVM signal, and `statsmodels.tsa.ar_model.AutoReg` to fit an autoregressive model to each axis of the accelerometer data. These libraries are commonly used for signal processing and time-series analysis and should be installed in your Python environment using pip.

The `extract_features` function is designed to be applied to each segment of accelerometer data independently to generate a feature vector that can be used for machine learning model training and activity recognition. The function assumes that the accelerometer data has already been segmented into windows.</span>

This module can be used as part of a human activity recognition system:

```python

        # Classification
        out = self.fc(context_vector)

lstm_layers = 2  # Number of layers in LSTM

# Instantiate the model
model = ConvLSTMWithAttention(input_size, num_classes, lstm_hidden_size, lstm_layers)

# Explanations of the code:
# - The class `ConvLSTMWithAttention` defines a neural network model for activity recognition.
# - The model uses a convolutional layer followed by max pooling to extract spatial features from the input accelerometer data.
# - An LSTM network captures temporal dependencies within the sequence of features output by the CNN.
# - An attention mechanism is implemented to prioritize the most informative parts of the LSTM output.
# - The final classification is performed by a fully connected layer that takes the context vector from the attention mechanism.
# - This model can be trained on segmented and labeled accelerometer data to recognize human activities.
```

This model can be trained using a standard training loop and optimization techniques in PyTorch. The input to this model should be a batch of sequences where each sequence is a segment of accelerometer data with a shape that matches the input size expected by the first convolutional layer. The output will be a set of logits corresponding to the activity class predictions for each sequence in the batch.</span>

# Explanations of the code:
# - The function 'k_fold_cross_validation' performs k-fold cross-validation and hyperparameter optimization for a neural network model.
# - It iterates over all combinations of hyperparameters provided in the 'hyperparameters' dictionary.
# - For each combination, it performs k-fold cross-validation to evaluate the model's accuracy.
# - It tracks the best performing model and hyperparameters based on the average accuracy across folds.
# - The best model, along with its hyperparameters and accuracy, is returned after evaluating all combinations.
```

This function uses a brute-force approach to iterate over all possible combinations of hyperparameters. In a real-world scenario with a larger hyperparameter space, more sophisticated techniques such as Bayesian optimization or genetic algorithms would be more efficient. The function assumes that an appropriate dataset and model class are provided and that the necessary preprocessing steps have been performed.</span>

Now, we are generating code segment for step By following these steps and integrating the mentioned technologies and algorithms, the human activity recognition system's performance should improve, potentially achieving or surpassing the target average recognition accuracy of 0.90. Each step aims to enhance the system's ability to process and learn from the accelerometer data effectively.

To run the script, save it as `har_system.py` and execute it with the command `python3 har_system.py -i &lt;path_to_WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt&gt;`, replacing `&lt;path_to_WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt&gt;` with the actual path to the WISDM dataset file.

Please note that the functions `ActivityRecognitionModel`, `preprocess_data`, `extract_features`, `train_model`, and `evaluate_model` are placeholders and should be replaced with the complete implementations discussed in the previous steps. This code assumes that the dataset is formatted correctly and that the necessary preprocessing steps have been performed. The model should be trained and evaluated to recognize human activities based on the accelerometer data provided in the WISDM dataset.</span>

## Introduction

### User's Problem
The user aims to develop a human activity recognition (HAR) system using the Wireless Sensor Data Mining (WISDM) dataset. This dataset includes accelerometer data collected from smartphones, which can be used to identify human activities. The task involves preprocessing the WISDM data, dividing it into training and testing parts, constructing a machine learning model for activity recognition, and finally evaluating the model's average recognition accuracy on the test dataset.

### The Code
The provided code is a Python script that implements a HAR system using the PyTorch framework. The script is designed to run on systems with a powerful GPU and uses a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and attention mechanisms to classify accelerometer data into activity categories.

## Getting Started

### Installation
Before running the code, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- scikit-learn

You can install the required libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas scipy scikit-learn torch
```

### Usage
To use the HAR system, follow these steps:
1. Place the `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file in an accessible directory.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```
   python har_system.py -i path_to_WISDM_dataset_file
   ```
   Replace `path_to_WISDM_dataset_file` with the actual path to your `WISDM_ar_v1.1_raw.txt` file.

### Troubleshooting
- If you encounter any errors regarding missing libraries, make sure all the required libraries are installed.
- Ensure that your GPU drivers and CUDA (if using NVIDIA GPUs) are up to date for optimal performance.
- If you receive an out-of-memory error, try reducing the batch size or using a simpler model.

## Explanation

The script is divided into several sections, each performing specific tasks:

### AttentionModule Class
Defines an attention mechanism for the LSTM outputs, which helps the model focus on the most relevant features for classification.

### EnhancedHARModel Class
The main model class, combining CNN, LSTM, and attention layers for feature extraction and classification.

### load_and_preprocess_data Function
Responsible for loading the WISDM dataset from the provided file path, preprocessing it using z-score normalization, segmenting it into windows, and encoding the labels.

### main Function
The entry point of the script, where the data is loaded, preprocessed, split into training and testing sets, and fed into the model for training and evaluation.

### Command Line Argument Parsing
Allows the user to specify the path to the dataset file when running the script from the command line.

## FAQs

**Q: What activities can the HAR system recognize?**
A: The activities recognizable by the system depend on the labels present in the WISDM dataset. Common activities include walking, jogging, sitting, standing, and climbing stairs.

**Q: Can I use the code with a different dataset?**
A: Yes, but you may need to adjust the preprocessing function to fit the format of your dataset.

**Q: How can I improve the model's accuracy?**
A: You can experiment with different architectures, hyperparameters (such as learning rate and batch size), or even augment the dataset to improve the model's performance.

**Q: What should I do if the model is overfitting?**
A: Consider using techniques such as dropout, regularization, or reducing the complexity of the model to combat overfitting.

**Q: The code is running slow, what can I do?**
A: Ensure that the code is utilizing your GPU. You can also try reducing the model's complexity or batch size to speed up training.</span>
